Add README.md

# Hello!
I am readmebot, a bot that finds repositories with no README file, and submits a pull request to add one.

## The pull request includes:
- The repository name as the main heading
- The description of the repository underneath the title
- Extra headers that (that you can remove because (`edits by maintainers are on`) such as: Installation, Contributing, Dependancies, the and usage.

Feel free to make any changes that you feel are necessary.

You don't even have to merge this PR! Just use it as a reminder to make a README file.
