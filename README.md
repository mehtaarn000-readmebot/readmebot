# cron-readmebot
The cronjob that finds repositories without a README file and submits a PR to add one.

## Inspiration
I've seen a lot a repositories that don't have a README.md file either because the owner is lazy, or just forgot to add one. 

So, I made this cronjob that finds these repositories and submits a pull request to add one.
